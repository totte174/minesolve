# minesweeper-probability

## Future features
generalize to N-dimensional minesweeper
generalize to allow enabling of wrapping edges


## Possible improvements to winrate
brute force??

## Possible improvements to performance
Improvements to equation reduction to possibly split the really hard border which cause the solver to run out of memory
