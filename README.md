# **mssolve** - The world's most powerful minesweeper solver

## Future features
- generalize to N-dimensional minesweeper
- generalize to allow enabling of wrapping edges


## Possible improvements to winrate
- more brute force?
- scale search depth on edge size


## Possible improvements on 
- transposition table
- more pruning

## Possible improvements to stability
- Improvements to equation reduction to possibly split the really hard border which cause the solver to run out of memory
